            <div class="about-text">
                <p>The CE Next Generation Camp, Batch 1, was held from November 16-19, 2023, at the Faculty of Engineering, Computer Engineering Department, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Laskrabang (KMITL). This camp provided an in-depth introduction to computer engineering, offering a hands-on learning experience that went beyond classroom concepts. It covered topics like the Internet of Things (IoT), circuit design, and programming, blending theory with practical applications to give us a taste of the real-world challenges and solutions in engineering.</p>
                <p>During our time at camp, we engaged in interactive workshops and exercises that helped us understand IoT fundamentals and practice assembling circuits. Through these activities, we learned about how electronic components work together, which was both challenging and rewarding. We also received guidance on programming and coding essentials, gaining a firsthand look at the logic, problem-solving, and precision needed to code effectively in the engineering field. These technical skills were essential, but the camp also emphasized personal growth and soft skills.</p>
                <p>The camp provided opportunities for us to develop essential teamwork skills, as we collaborated on projects that required strong communication and group coordination. We practiced public speaking, shared ideas confidently, and learned the importance of listening to different perspectives, helping us become more open-minded. Additionally, we worked on leadership and initiative, taking turns leading projects and problem-solving tasks.</p>
                <p>Overall, attending this camp gave us a chance to experience what studying computer engineering entails. It allowed us to explore our fit and passion for this field and gain a clearer sense of our academic and career goals. The experience was not only educational but also memorable, helping each of us take another step forward in understanding whether we truly enjoy and are suited to this field.</p>
