        <h2>ModCom Mystery Camp</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>The ModCom Mystery Camp was specifically designed to welcome new students into the Computer Engineering Department at King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT). This unique camp aimed to facilitate connections among first-year students, helping them build a sense of camaraderie and teamwork with their peers while also acquainting them with the department, its culture, and the study of computer engineering.</p>
                <p>From the outset, the camp offered a variety of team-building exercises and icebreaker activities, encouraging students to work together and bond with classmates they would be learning alongside for the next several years. These activities allowed students to connect not just on an academic level, but also on a personal one, fostering friendships and a support network that would likely be invaluable as they tackle the rigorous challenges of their degree. Each activity was designed to promote trust, cooperation, and communication, which are essential skills in both academic and professional engineering environments.</p>
                <p>In addition to fostering friendships, the ModCom Mystery Camp provided students with an introductory foundation in computer engineering, covering essential concepts and skills that would form the basis of their studies. Through hands-on workshops and practical demonstrations, students were introduced to the basics of computer systems, programming, and problem-solving techniques. These foundational lessons aimed to give students a head start, preparing them for the more complex material they would encounter in their coursework.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the camp included presentations from faculty members and senior students, who shared their experiences and insights into the field of computer engineering. These sessions provided valuable perspectives on what students could expect from their academic journey and the potential career paths they could explore within the field. The interactions with seniors also allowed the new students to ask questions and receive advice on study strategies, time management, and making the most of their time in the program.</p>
                <p>Overall, the ModCom Mystery Camp was much more than an orientation event; it was a comprehensive introduction to the world of computer engineering at KMUTT. It helped students feel welcome, encouraged a sense of belonging, and provided a solid foundation that would support their academic and personal growth throughout their time at university. By the end of the camp, students not only felt more connected to each other but also gained a greater sense of confidence and readiness to embark on their journey in computer engineering.</p>
