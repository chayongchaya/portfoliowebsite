        <h2>The Academic and EQ Development Camp 18</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>The Academic and EQ Development Camp, now in its 18th year, took place at River Kwai Village Hotel in Kanchanaburi. During the camp, I was assigned various roles to ensure smooth operations and a successful experience for everyone involved. My primary responsibilities included being part of the coordination team, where I assisted in organizing and managing different aspects of the camp activities. I also took on the role of camp photographer, capturing the lively atmosphere and the participants’ engagement in each activity.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I served as a senior team leader at one of the activity stations, where I was responsible for guiding and supporting younger participants. This role allowed me to create a fun and informative environment, helping them to enjoy and learn from each task. Through these activities, the camp aimed to foster EQ development, leadership, and essential skills such as confidence, public speaking, and presentation.</p>
                <p>Overall, this experience was both challenging and fulfilling, providing me with a platform to strengthen my leadership abilities and refine other interpersonal skills. It was rewarding to contribute to an environment that encouraged participants to grow personally and develop skills that would be valuable in future endeavors.</p>
