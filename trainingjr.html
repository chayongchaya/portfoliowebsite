        <h2>Fundamental Course for Junior Students</h2>

            <div class="about-text">
                <p>During the foundational skills training activities for students in the Special Program for Science, Mathematics, and Computer Studies, I had the privilege of contributing as an assistant instructor. In this role, I was responsible for helping to convey complex concepts and providing educational support to younger students. My primary duties included clarifying concepts in science, math, and computer studies, answering questions, and offering guidance to ensure that each student could fully understand the material. I took time to listen to their inquiries and provide explanations, often breaking down complicated topics into more manageable parts, fostering a supportive and encouraging learning environment.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I led recreational activities aimed at both entertaining and educating the students. Serving as an activity leader, I planned and conducted various interactive exercises that promoted teamwork, critical thinking, and creativity. My goal was to create a dynamic atmosphere where students could enjoy learning through play, feeling both challenged and motivated. These activities allowed students to practice what they learned in a relaxed setting, reinforcing their knowledge and boosting their confidence.</p>
                <p>This experience offered me a valuable opportunity to build my communication and teaching skills, especially in presenting ideas in a way that was engaging and accessible for younger learners. It was rewarding to see students become more confident in their abilities and willing to explore new ideas. My time as an assistant instructor and activity leader provided insight into the importance of mentorship and support in education, helping students feel understood and capable of success in a challenging academic program.</p>
